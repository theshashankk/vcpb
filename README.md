# 🎧 The Shashank music bomt — The Telegram voice chat bot to be open-sourced

## 💭 Logic

The only thing VCPB does for you is automating the audio streaming process, it doesn’t directly play audio in group calls. So you have to forward the audio that VCPB plays to a Telegram call manually using Telegram desktop app on your PC or server with a desktop environment.

### 🛠 Config

Pass CLI args when running or copy config/sample_config.py to config/config.py
    
### ✍️ Install the required packages

```shell
sudo apt install mpv libmpv-dev pulseaudio &&
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```
### ✨ Run the bot

```shell
python3 main.py  
```
